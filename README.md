Swift Type is a fun and engaging typing speed test application that offers users the opportunity to enhance their typing skills. Users can start the test with a variety of texts, and the application will track and display their typing speed (WPM), character count (CPM), accuracy, and errors in real-time. After the test, users receive a detailed summary of their performance.

## Features

- **Welcome Screen**: Provides instructions and a start button to begin the test.
- **Typing Test Interface**:
  - Real-time tracking of WPM, CPM, errors, and accuracy.
  - Random text generation for varied typing practice.
  - Timer to limit the test to 60 seconds.
- **Result Section**:
  - Displays detailed performance statistics including time taken, words left, and characters left.
  - Star rating system for user feedback.
  - Option to restart the test.
## Future Functionality

In future updates, we plan to introduce several additional features to enhance the Swift Type experience:

- **User Profiles**: Allow users to create profiles to track their progress over time.
- **Custom Text Input**: Enable users to input their own text for typing practice.
- **Leaderboard**: Implement a leaderboard to showcase top performers.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Provide more detailed analytics and insights into typing performance.
- **Themes and Customization**: Offer users the ability to customize the interface with different themes and styles.

Stay tuned for these exciting updates!
